# Phase 2 plan: gaps carried over

Known gaps from Phase 1 specs, to take up after the core XP scope is delivered. The features of Phase 2 are in `docs/specs/INDEX.md`.

## From 0025 (pixel contract tests)
- The tint, the outline, the box's frame and the picture's far-edge resize handles may lie up to 2 device pixels off the drawn cell edges at a fractional zoom (accepted, JOD, 2026-11-02). `/0025-open/overlay_sides_at_fractional_zoom` is the known-red record.
- A fractional desktop scale (125 %, 150 %) keeps the renderer's scaling and has no test: only scale 1 and scale 2 have been tried.
- A screen of scale 2 has been tried only in the headless session, never by eye.
- The frame times of fractional zooms are not reliably measured: a covered window gets no frame callbacks on Wayland. The CPU figures stand, and M1 was smooth by eye (JOD, 2026-11-02).
- `append_float_outside` builds a texture it does not use and rebuilds the cells once per band: a small waste on a rare path.
- `perf-0025` keeps its diagnostic modes (`fractional`, `pencil`, `pencil-log`).
- The rule below 100 % at scale 2 in `canvas.c` is proved by its red run and by the core rule's mutant: `tools/mutate.sh` sessions are of scale 1 and cannot run a scale 2 mutant.
- A graphics path audit was named for this phase; it has no document yet.

## From the mutation list
- REQ-0017-14, the popover's scroll guard: survives on GTK 4.24, accepted (JOD, 2026-11-02). Re-decide at packaging-release, when the minimum GTK is chosen.
